	Author: Ramzi Chennafi, A00825005

Includes a project planning pdf, which has pseudocode and a diagram for the program. Also includes this readme and
the program + code. 

A simple program for initiating serial connections, then receiving and sending keyboard input. Begin a
connection by hitting the "Connect" button after deciding on port and data transfer settings. Hit escape
to disconnect from the current session.

Currently defaults to the com1 port on start-up.

Note: I/O done in synchronous mode, so I/O cannot be received and sent at the same time.
